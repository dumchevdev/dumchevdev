### Summary

I’m a game developer with nearly 4 years of commercial experience in Unity3D and C#. 
Recently, I worked on a large multiplayer project with over 50M installs. 
My core strength lies in meta-game mechanics, and I’m currently focusing on 
netcode and core gameplay development. I also have experience in 
developing Idle Tycoon games, PC/VR simulation training,  
client-server applications and chatbots in Python.
