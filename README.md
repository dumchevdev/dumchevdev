### SUMMURY

I am a game developer with nearly 4 years of commercial experience in Unity3D and C#. The last project I worked on was a multiplayer game with over 50 million installs. My main focus is on meta-mechanics, but currently, I am concentrating on developing netcode and core-gameplay mechanics. I also have experience in developing VR training simulators and client-server applications using Python.
